# Death By Audio Arcade Presskit

This is the presskit for the Death By Audio Arcade collective. These aren't all the files in the presskit, but they are the primary ones that affect the site/that you'll need to edit.

* `data.xml` holds all the information that populates the presskit. This is where you want to add press, update our description, etc.

* `images`, as you may have guessed, holds all the images. Note that the header image has to be called `header.png`.

The site will not update automatically--make a pull request and nudge one of us to update the files.
